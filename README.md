# Hospital-Management-System-HMS-
A Java GUI-based desktop application to manage core operations in a hospital or healthcare facility. Developed as part of a Java programming internship, this project demonstrates modular design and practical implementation of Java Swing for user interface development.


##  Features

The system is divided into six functional modules:

- ** Patient Registration** – Add new patient records with personal details.
- ** Appointment Scheduling** – Book appointments for patients with specific doctors.
- ** Electronic Health Records (EHR)** – Store diagnosis, prescriptions, and medical notes.
- ** Billing and Invoicing** – Generate and print patient invoices based on services.
- ** Inventory Management** – Manage medical stock and expiry tracking.
- ** Staff Management** – Maintain staff schedules and roles (Doctor/Nurse/Admin).
